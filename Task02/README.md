# Task 02 
## 1. Nine Pillars Understanding

### Q1: Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?

Using AI agents for repetitive setup work saves your time and energy. Instead of getting stuck doing the same boring tasks again and again, you can focus on planning the system, designing its structure, and thinking about how different parts should work together. This helps you grow as a system architect because your mind stays on higher-level decisions, not on small technical steps.

### Q2: How do the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer?

The Nine Pillars give a complete development structure where AI handles routine coding and tools integrate smoothly. Because of this support, a developer can learn and go deep in multiple areas at the same time—like backend, testing, architecture, DevOps, and deployment. This multi-domain depth is what creates an M-Shaped developer.

## 2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development

### Q1: Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?

Vibe Coding causes problems because there is no proper plan or structure. You write whatever “feels right” in the moment. After a few days, the project becomes confusing, hard to extend, and difficult to debug because nothing was clearly defined from the start.

### Q2: How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?

Specification-Driven Development avoids these issues by forcing you to write clear requirements first. The system is planned, documented, and structured before any code is generated. Since everything is defined upfront, the project stays organized, consistent, and easy to maintain.

## 3. Architecture Thinking

### Q1: How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?

Architecture-first thinking shifts a developer’s role from just writing code to designing the entire system. You spend more time on decisions like structure, flow, quality, and validation, while AI handles most of the coding. This makes the developer more like a system designer and less like a traditional coder.

### Q2: Why must developers think in layers and systems instead of raw code?

Thinking in layers helps you understand how different parts of the system connect and depend on each other. It avoids messy code and makes the project scalable, secure, and easier to update. Raw coding focuses only on single functions, but layered thinking ensures the whole system works smoothly as one unit.
